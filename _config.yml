user_description: I am a Computer Science Degree student and enthusiastic app developer. I started to programme when I was a teenager. Since then I have never stopped to learn new things and to accept new challenges. I have worked on several personal and professional projects using different technologies, such as Augmented Reality or Geospatial data. Recently I started to learn Google Tango and AR technologies to boost my career.
